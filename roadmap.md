<h1 align="center">Orbital Game Engine Roadmap</h1>

<p>This shows my current plans for Orbital, as well as some major milestones I want to hit. Note that this may change, as at the end of the day, this is meant to be a learning project for me to learn the ropes
of game engine development and I may change my goals based on what I want to learn.</p>

<h3>Current Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create a game window</li>
  <li>Input system</li>
  <li>Delta Time and a Scene Manager and Scene System</li>
  <li>Basic 2D rendering</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems quite tame, but again, this is a learning project, and currently, these are the topics im interested in for now.</p>
