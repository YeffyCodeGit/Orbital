<h2 align="center">About</h2>
<p>Orbital is meant to be a powerful, yet simple 2D and 3D game engine. It started as a C++ and Direct3D project, though I decided to move it to Java and LWJGL. The engine is under development and all support/and or contribution is very welcome!</p>

<h2 align="center">How to use it</h2>
<p>Setting Orbital up is pretty simple. To set up Orbital you need to: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Clone the repository into a folder.</li>
    <li>Open it with your IDE or Code Editor of choice (personally, I use IntelliJ Idea)</li>
    <li>Run the `Main.java` file.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<p>Do note that Orbital is in its early development stages, so there isn't really much you can do with it. At the time of writing, you can render a window and simple 2D graphics, get user input and use a camera system (kinda). If you would like to add any functionality, you can add in the `update` function in the LevelEditorScene.java file, without editing the already existing code there. I suggest you make your own function and call that in update, and place the logic inside that function.</p>

<h2 align="center">Help</h2>
<p>If you have any inquiries or want any help about the engine, feel free to contact me on discord! My user tag is #5084 and my username is Yeff. You can also visit the support server, which is linked at the top of this readme.</p>
